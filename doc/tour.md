# Nim Example
## Hello World
The code for a simple hello world program is as follows:
```nim
echo "Hello World"
```
Save this text as helloworld.nim. To compile and execute the program, the following command should be run

```nim
$ nim c -r --verbose:0 helloworld.nim
Hello World
```

The command has several elements:

* `c` is an alias for `compile`, which compiles the Nim sources into C and then imvokes the C compiler on them
* `-r` is an alias for `--run`, which runs the program
* `--verbosity:0` makes the compiler only output essential messages, since by default it also outputs some debugging messages. From now on, we assume that `--verbosity:0` is set
* `./helloworld.nim` is the path to the source you want to compile

## Variables
Nim supports three different types of variables, `let`, `var`, and `const`. As with most things, multiple variables can be declaredin the same section.

```nim
proc getAlphabet(): string =
  var accm = ""
  for letter in 'a'..'z': # see iterators
    accm.add(letter)
  return accm

# Computed at compilation time
const alphabet = getAlphabet()

# Mutable Variable
var
  a = "foo"
  b = 0
  # Works fine, initialized to 0
  c: int

# Immutable Variables
let
  d = "foo"
  e = 5
  # Compile-time error, must be initialized
  # f: float
# Works fine, 'a' is Mutable
a.add("bar")
b += 1
c = 3

#[ Compile-time error, const cannot be modified at run-time
alphabet = "abc"
]#

#[ Compile-time error, 'd' and 'e' are Immutable
d.add("bar")
e += 1]#
```

```sh
$ nim c --verbosity:2 ./variables.nim
variables.nim(22, 2) Error: 'let' symbol requires on initialization
  f:float
```
Without `--verbosity:2` only the error will be shown without the position cursor.

### Const
A `const` variable's value will be evaluated at compile-time, so if you inspect the C sources, you'll see the following line:

```nim
STRING_LITERAL(TMP129, "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", 26)
```

The only limitation with const is that compile-time evaluation cannot interface with C because there is no compile-time foreign function interface at this time.

### Result
The `result` variable is a special variable that serves as an implicit return variable, which exists because the control flow semantics of the return statement are rarely needed. The result variable is initialized in the standard way, as it it was declared with var result: `ReturnType`. For example, the `getAlphabet()` function could be rewritten more concisely as:

```Nim
proc getAlphabet(): string =
  result = ""
  for letter in 'a'..'z':
    result.add(letter)
```

A possible gotcha is declaring a new variable called `result` and expecting it to have the same semantics.

```Nim
proc unexpected(): int =
  var result = 5
  result += 5

echo unexpected() # Prints 0, not 10
#[
　結局、resultという変数は宣言できても同じ振る舞いをするわけではない
　ということ。戻り値用途のスタックとして存在はしていない。
]#
```

### Type Casting and Inference
Nim is a statically
